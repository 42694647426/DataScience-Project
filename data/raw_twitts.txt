@Eneri96752758 @GMB You can‚Äôt let Covid stop your life forever you‚Äôll become ill from the depression. Maybe I‚Äôve been lucky but I‚Äôve had Covid twice and so have most people I know. Not nice but we all got through it and have managed to do a lot of fun things these past 2 years.
@ImEvanTsai @sugan2503 Was expecting this. If you were on the fence a couple of months ago when it became eligible (18 to 34), you would have seen things are going down rapidly. Covid appeared to be virtually gone in SA for weeks now, so you would have thought "Why get it?". With Omicron, minds change.

Omicron-test positive for covid, theres no test that shows a variant. Calling a variant is based on symptoms that are different than we've seen to date.

Getting my eyebrows threaded for the first time since COVID hit
Can someone help me with this?. . I am vaccinated against all the usual stuff- measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, etc. So I can‚Äôt get these diseases.. . If the COVID vax is truly a vaccine by definition, then why can I still get COVID &amp; possibly even die from it?
@SummYunggGuyy @TomiLahren https://t.co/YhAxMg5gOa. . And this is one rare incident . I'm sure the vaccinated people's IMMUNITY will be 100%. . SOOOON.. Keep shooting Blanks. Your bound to stop coronavirus with vaccinated IMMUNITY.
@PangaStock @compguru910 @LadeBackk @jimcramer It's not 1% tho it's less and some of the deaths counted as a covid death, didn't even die from covid. https://t.co/nFDXwSdVCs
@EnricoPallazo5 @_Langhorne @TimRunsHisMouth @tahliasarv @9NewsDarwin @9NewsAUS The people in the facility are forced to be Quarantine when arriving from overseas.  The states all agreed to this process and if you ever visited Australia,  you may well have had to visit that facility.  It remains a clear and effective way of isolating Covid cases.
everything i‚Äôve eaten for the last 24 hours has tasted funny or bland so i took a covid test and i‚Äôm fortunately negative. . . maybe it‚Äôs all the tequila shots we took on tour lmao
@BeardedAndBased What is so concerning to you about this report? It confirms that you‚Äôre about twice as likely to contract Covid if you‚Äôre unvaccinated.  Confirms you‚Äôre much more likely to be hospitalized. As for deaths, the explanation is complex but logical
@Avry Try leaving downtown in the afternoon on a day during Stampede before covid and its +35 out
@RepThomasMassie COVID approves this message.  In light of this with the backdrop of the shooting in Michigan today, this tweet seems appropriate.

@ProjectLincoln What was Trump‚Äôs motive after he knew he tested positive for Covid to lie about it so he could still attend an event that could have been easily rebooked for date after he tested negative?  Trump is a cheater so my guess is he wanted to infect Biden hoping it would eliminate him! https://t.co/dfsXhAXe5Y

They will respond that these were caused by covid or a new dangerous variant and that without vaccines incidents of cardiac arrest would have been much more-sadly  many will believe that-they just do not want to accept the reality of the situation. https://t.co/q1HN6oFreY

@MeadowGood @Imm05M @IvoryMikeNICET2 @GovRonDeSantis Just ignore the fact hospitals worldwide are experiencing ‚Äúmysterious‚Äù illnesses amongst vaccinated patients, &amp; less than 1% of VAERS vaccine deaths are actually reported (Harvard).

@tvcritics Plenty of twisted brainwashed clueless parents. Putting a single use germ ridden face rag on a kid for prolonged periods is child abuse. No wonder there has been a surge in hospital admissions for kids suffering non Covid respiratory ailments.  Surely you don't condone this?
We would like an explanation about this new omicron covid-19 what the hell is it they have no idea they have no idea where it came from or even that it exists so how in the hell are they testing people for the omicron virus when they don't even know what it is I want to know

From study: "primary outcome was any confirmed case of Covid-19 that occurred between December 8, 2020, and March 3, 2021". . That means no Delta variant. . Is it too difficult for you to actually read before posting?
@MsJulieLenarz @CHSommers According to @theintercept , the COVID created in Fauci endorsed "gain of function" research was too dissimilar to be COVID-19. Doesn't preclude the lab using the expertise of Ecohealth Alliance / Fauci which started China on a path of experimenting on the spike protein.
@DavetheStag @ClaireMcJoyce @mattletiss7 Now we both you're lying. Many fully vaccinated people are dying of Covid. . . It sounds like you just believe everything you're told. Are you afraid to do your own research?
Why aren't leftists calling Biden a murderer considering covid deaths are higher this year than last year? #BidenBodyCount
@ConorRyan_93 So genuinely curious, we aren‚Äôt able to call up any players from prov because covid over there and we‚Äôre already down to like 19 skaters on our active roster‚Ä¶what happens if we get some positive tests? We just gonna play with 16 guys?
@vveeeeeets Used to hear the same bullshit about Greene. But now it‚Äôs even more absurd because during covid only a limited number of guys are even available to media. People get pissy when the team loses and pin it on the captain.

@bp22 Ya the vaccine doesn‚Äôt do much to prevent the new covid strain. Hopefully omicron isn‚Äôt as deadly as delta, if it is then hopefully they develop a new targeted vaccine fast, but early reports point to it not being as serious as previous strains ü§ûü§ûü§û

@libbage55 @MeghanMcCain 750,000 people did not die OF Covid, All of the ‚Äúdata‚Äùreported is garbage. Once they started paying hospitals, etc, tens of thousands of dollars for each Covid death, not a soul died from anything other than Covid. BTW, the vaccinated are the ones dying now. Masks do nothing.

@DrEliDavid Lebron James.  Fully vaccinated and 3 boosters laters needs, has been infected with covid anyway and now needs 15 days per NBA protocol which will include 2 more tests. And 2 more boosters before he can play again, this is 2021 science.
@tify330 @CarrieCnh12 Leaving WHO in the wake of how they seem to be acting around China and Taiwan with respect to COVID is probably the only decision I didn't disagree with
