@aussiedadbod @matthewdmarsden I'm sure even Texas having 36 times as many Covid deaths as Australia won't budge Matthew's opinion one iota, since he appears thoroughly immune to logic.

@seanhannity Because Fauci wants as much COVID scare as possible in this country, to gain as much power as possible for himself and his masters.  He lost all credibility forever when he claimed “questioning me is questioning science”. Megalomaniac.  Different issue? Nonsense.
