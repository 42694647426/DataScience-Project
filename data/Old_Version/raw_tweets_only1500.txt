@MSNBC @thereidout I suppose that Abbott and his repuglican-led state legislators are so busy killing folks with covid  unmasking mandates they've no time to worry about mere families and helpless enfants going w/o power/heat freezing to death this winter. Sad, Horrific Criminal if it happens again
@yourbrainistiny @BruiserK @wendelltalks @thatbrian @dmeckle Like I said, you must research data prior to covid.  Everything after that has been changed to support the narrative. Seriously just research 2016, 2017...consensus was surgical mask only used for tradition. Only a properly fitted AND handled P95 mask has any effect whatsoever.
@UnsilencedOrg Won't work... Vaccine hesitancy is strong there due to leaders spreading conspiracies about vaccines having HIV to infect Africans.  This is a very real thing.  Many African countries are in the single digits COVID vax-wise and it isn't all down to supply issues.

@MoiraDonegan Being nostalgic for orphanages to come back is no reason to do this. As an adopted person, she is wrong to assume adoption is fun &amp; not traumatic for any of us. We already have 120,000 to 5 million kids who lost a caretaker to COVID &amp; now we want more traumatized kids to join in?

@Guiller07218172 @TheOGpianoGeek I think we should do what NYC does.They have an app that verifies covid vaccination &amp; you have to show it to get in to restaurants, shows, etc. People feel very safe and it has caused 90% vaccination rate.

@CDCgov I remember when the CDC said to get the covid vaccine to prevent getting covid. Now that fully vaccinated are getting covid they changed the tune to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs less severe‚Äù. Wonder what they will say when fully vaccinated people are dying in high numbers. Oh that‚Äôs right they are
@see_shelz @thelyckek @Paul_Jensen142 @MissJLH @IMakeHimPaYY @Lj_Foster This is understandable. But, one thing we do know with certainty is that covid is deadly. And even for folks who don't die, longterm symptoms are brutal. That's what motivated me to get the vaccine. That and having kids with asthma who have no choice but to go into schools.

@JenNWCbus yea... my hospital is starting to have a covid wing... again
@ClimateNexus @SenSchumer Don‚Äôt be fooled this is bad for American.  By the way the job claims are a sham as well.  We lost 9.6 million jobs during COVID.  The current administration is puffing their chest about 5 +million new jobs.  Not hard to add jobs when so many businesses are opening back up in 2021
@RaxSapp @LGSusanB So if *some* jobs were allowed to fire you if you‚Äôve had an abortion you‚Äôd be ok with this? . . Pregnancy isn‚Äôt contagious. But the vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop you from catching or spreading COVID. So that‚Äôs not a good counter argument.

@Justprintmonies @sykristinsson @ptaipale @VincentRK I think that covid is a very serious disease and that therapeutics reduce the seriousness for some versus not been jabbed with the therapeutic vaccines.

Quite a bit of fear and chaos in the travel sector, which isn't surprising. I have been buying the dip in $SPR, but it's not clear to me when we see an inflection point. From what I can see, this new strain of covid is weaker, but can evade the vaccine. Take that as you will.

@exitdave @jordanbpeterson We had them too where I came from. If we travelled up in Africa we couldn't get back into South Africa without a valid yellow fever immunisation card.

Alternately, not vaxx'd you have a statistically greater chance of having more serious, possibly severe, symptoms.  Which is preferable?
